# B. Secure

## Problems with the current password managers:
Single point of failure: if the server/database goes down, there goes your passwords

Trust issue: can you really trust that these closed-source softwares will not just read your passwords?

## B. Secure solves all the mentioned problems:
The passwords are stored on the decentralized database that is the Polygon blockchain, hence it will not go down easily

The passwords are encrypted by your private key which belongs to only you. You are the only one who can see your saved passwords.

## Inspiration

> One potential source could be personal experience with password managers and frustration with their limitations and security concerns. Many people use password managers to store and generate strong, unique passwords for all their accounts, but there are often concerns about the security of these password managers, especially if they are closed-source or rely on a centralized server.

> Another potential source of inspiration could be the growing demand for secure and decentralized technologies, particularly in the wake of high-profile data breaches and privacy concerns. Decentralized technologies like blockchain are becoming increasingly popular for their potential to provide a more secure and transparent way to store and share data.

> Finally, inspiration for a project like B. Secure could come from a desire to create a meaningful impact in the world. By creating a more secure and user-friendly password manager, you could help people protect their sensitive information and prevent cyberattacks, which could ultimately have a positive impact on society as a whole.
